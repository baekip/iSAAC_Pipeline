[[9,8.5]]
* If the variant is applicable to multiple regions, the variant will be counted repeatedly.
	● Sample ID: ID provided from customer
	● DOWNSTREAM: Downstream of a gene (default length:5K bases)
	● EXON: The variant hits a gene
	● INTERGENIC: The variant is in an intergenic region
	● INTRON: Variant hits and intron. Technically, hits no exon in the transcript
	● SPLICE_SITE_ACCEPTOR: The variant hits a splice acceptor site
	● SPLICE_SITE_DONOR: The variant hits a splice donor site
	● SPLICE_SITE_REGION: The variant hits a splice region site
	● TRANSCRIPT: The variant hits a transcript
	● UPSTREAM: Upstream of a gene (default length: 5K bases)
	● UTR_3_PRIME: Variant hits 3'UTR region
	● UTR_5_PRIME: Variant hits 5'UTR region
