¡Ü The mapping process is to compare the sequenced reads to a customer-designated reference gonome using string alignment algorithm.
¡Ü Sample ID: ID provided from customer
¡Ü Sequence read: Unfiltered sequence
¡Ü Deduplicated read: Discarded clean reads following PCR duplicate
¡Ü Mapping read: De-duplicated reads followed by mapping onto the reference genome 
¡Ü Unique read: Reads with the same starting position on each end
