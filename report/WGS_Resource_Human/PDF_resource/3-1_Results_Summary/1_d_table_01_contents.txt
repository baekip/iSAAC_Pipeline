¡Ü The mapping process is to compare the sequenced reads to a customer-designated reference gonome using string alignment algorithm.
¡Ü Sample ID: ID provided from customer
¡Ü Mapped Read: Total number of mapped reads
¡Ü Mapped Base: Total number of mapped bases (nucleotide)
¡Ü Mean Insert Size (std): Mean, standard deviation of the insert size distribution if applicable.
¡Ü Mean Coverage (std): Mean, standard deviation of coverage is calculated based on extraction of pair overlap-region
